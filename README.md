Envato Buyer Data
=====================

Envato Buyer Data uses the Envato Marketplace API to see if a user has in fact bought the item he needs support for. The script uses the seller's username, API key along with a purchase code provided by a buyer to check if that purchase code is valid or not.

If you'll enter any of your details wrong OR if the purchase code is not valid you will get an error. If the information provided is correct and the purchase code is valid you will get these details: Item Name, Item ID, Buyer Username, Date of Purchase and License Type!
